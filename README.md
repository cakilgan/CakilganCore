# Cakilgan Core

CakilganCore is a collection of utility libraries developed by me, i use this library for my most of the c++ projects.

This project is still in its infancy and is being actively developed. As such, it is not yet feature complete and is likely to change significantly over time.
## Contents

The library currently contains the following components:

1. **Color Utils**: A set of functions for working with colors in the terminal.
2. **Logic Utils**: A collection of functions for handling common logic operations, such as type handling.
3. **Math Utils**: A set of functions for performing mathematical operations.
4. **String Utils**: A collection of functions for working with strings.
5. **Test Utils**: tiny framework *BoltTest* for basic testing.
6. **Time Utils**: A set of functions for working with time and performance measurements.
7. **Token Utils**: A collection of functions for working with tokens in the context of lexical analysis.

These components are designed to be lightweight and easy to use **(not token_utils stay away from that)**, and can be used as a starting point for a wide range of projects.
